Bootstrap-context-menu
=======================

This simple library helps you to create context menu easily. Its first version so there is not much you will see in this.
I am thinking to implement this for AngularJS too.

To initiate context menu:

_context.menu(1,"nomenu");  //1-6 are themes for menu

To hide menu:

_context.menu("hide");


You can always suggest me anything regarding this or have any problem. Let me know at me@abhishekgahlot.com
