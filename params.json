Its first version so there is not much you will see in this.\r\nI am thinking to implement this for AngularJS too.\r\n\r\nTo initiate context menu:\r\n\r\n_context.menu(1,\"nomenu\");  //1-6 are themes for menu\r\n\r\nTo hide menu:\r\n\r\n_context.menu(\"hide\");\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can always suggest me anything regarding this or have any problem. Let me know at me@abhishekgahlot.com\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
